# One-shot-Image-Recognition-Using-Siamese-Neural-Networks
 This project focuses on implementing a Siamese Neural Network (SNN)  for one-shot image recognition on the AT&amp;T face dataset, following the  approach outlined by Koch, Zemel, and Salakhutdinov in their 2015 paper,  "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition" (oneshot1).
